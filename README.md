# :information_source: About 
It's a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) app. This is a group project by Zena, George and Asela. 

We used the Scavenger Hunt app as a guide when writing it. It was written in a step by step process. We collaborated via GitHub.

# :persevere: Lessons Learnt 
It took time to get used to how branches work and the correct way to use them. We encountered problems with collaborating via GitHub as some mistakes were made in the process of collaboration. These mistakes were fixed. We should have got more familiar with the GitHub collaboration process.
